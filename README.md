## Contribution

Help me enhance this project by adding brand logotypes. Your contributions to open-source initiative will contribute to a more comprehensive collection of logos. Join it in making this project complete by incorporating logos from various brands. Together, let's create a valuable resource for designers and developers worldwide.

I have tried to conceive this project from pure simplicity, from development to the contribution model.

### Adding new logotypes as a designer

1. The file names must follow a specific structure.

   I have created a naming structure for the files that automatically generates the API.

   `logoName-variant-version.svg`

   variant: `wordmark` / `glyph`  
   version: `color` / `black` / `white`

   For example: `nike-wordmark-black.svg`

2. Simply make a pull request including the logos in the [static/logos](static/logos) folder with the correct naming structure and in .svg format, and you're good to go!

### Improving the project as a developer

This project has been built by an inexperienced designer in coding and assisted by ChatGPT. (ðŸ˜¬). Please feel free to enhance or add any features to this project by submitting a pull request (PR). I welcome your contributions and appreciate any improvements you can make.
